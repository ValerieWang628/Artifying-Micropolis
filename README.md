# Adaptations of the original Micropolis
#### -- Adding museum as a new building into the SimCity
This is a program that is based on the orginal Micropolis game. 
Micropolis is based on the original SimCity from Electronic Arts / Maxis, and designed and written by Will Wright. 
The original Micropolis already has a well-formed system for electricity supply, traffic generation, pollution accumulation, city evaluation, and other important elements of SimCity.
However, as the early version does not have arts as an important aspect, I as the developer would like to add a museum feature here.
