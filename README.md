# Adaptations of the original Micropolis
#### -- Adding museum as a new building into the SimCity

## Project Overview
This is a program that is based on the orginal Micropolis game/
Micropolis is based on the original SimCity from Electronic Arts / Maxis, and designed and written by Will Wright. 
The original Micropolis already has a well-formed system for electricity supply, traffic generation, pollution accumulation, city evaluation, and other important elements of SimCity.
However, as the early version does not have arts as an important aspect, I as the developer would like to add a museum feature here. Thus, this will be a two-week project that aims to implement the museum & education feature.

## Design Documentation
The primary design documentation is a one-page design chart that concisely concludes the implementation plan. 
-- This design approach is inspired by [Stone Librande's GDC talk on one-page design](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1012356/One-Page).
Through one page, readers will be able to understand the core mechanism in the easiest way. And for the whole SimCity program where every mechanism can be conlcuded in one sheet, the entire program consists of multiple one-pagers.

The complete one-page design is here: [Design Chart]()
